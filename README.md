# ConvertImages
This script converts images in .bmp to .jpg. 

First, it will ask to the user insert the path and then will convert all .bmp files to .jpg, including the directory the user inserted and its subdirectories.
After that, it will move the older files(.bmp) to a backup folder.
This script is still in development and further will contain a GUI, with some other options, like:
- option to create the backup folder or no
- option to remove the files and just keep the converted or no
- more options of formats to conversion

The interface is being developed with the Python library tkinter.
